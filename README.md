Chapter 6 Exercise 5 from "C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition)" by Stephen Prata

Others have posted the exercise problems from this book, but I was proud of this one.  From the book: 

"Have a program request the user to enter an uppercase letter.  Use nested loops to produce a pyramid pattern like this:

    A  
   ABA  
  ABCBA  
 ABCDBCA  

The pattern should extend to the character entered."
